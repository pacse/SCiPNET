The site's founding was finally approved despite several years of anomalous activity occurring within the region, with Director Heba Gomaa spearheading efforts to get a location founded on the African continent.The site specializes mainly in underworld and mythological anomalies, which seem to be the most prevalent kinds of anomalies within its region. Its main purpose is to be a hub for containment and research for these anomalies. It also serves as an observation post for the Nile River, a location that has very recently become an area of high anomalous activity.Currently, the site suffers from gross mismanagement, mainly stemming from a lack of funding or aid from Central Command. The effects of this mismanagement include a lack of proper cooling equipment, outdated audio/visual systems and inadequate on-site containment facilities. Site administration has often been forced into making use of hack-job solutions for resolving these issues and maintaining site operations."
