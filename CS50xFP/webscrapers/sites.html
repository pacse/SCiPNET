<p><strong>Location:</strong> Las Vegas, Nevada, USA</p>
<p>The American Site-45 was established as a provisional measure to contain an abnormally high number of anomalous events in the Las Vegas district. The Site specialises in anomalies relating to religion and mythology, and consults on offsite anomalies such as <a href="/scp-2988">SCP-2988</a> and <a href="/scp-3998">SCP-3998</a>. The Site itself consists of three connected structures - an office building within city limits (Site-45-A), a newer facility disguised as a private mental care institution (Site-45-B) and a subterranean research facility (Site-45-C).</p>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> Chiyoda City, Tokyo, Japan</p>
<p>Located beneath the National Diet building complex, Site-50 (also referred to as Site-8150) was the former Headquarters of the <a href="/ijamea-hub">Imperial Japanese Anomalous Matters Examination Agency</a>, before being taken over by the Foundation in 1946 to serve as the center for the review of records previously collected by Japanese normalcy organisations. This role was expanded over time, and the Site now holds data on anomalies from across Japan, with more than 50 Departments present at the Site. Containment is relatively limited, mostly holding Safe or immobile anomalies, although the Site is also responsible for monitoring a number of anomalies in the Tokyo Prefecture.</p>

Featuring an extensive rapid-response vehicle hangar (with transport both normal and <a href="/fresh-blood">anomalous</a>) and a wide array of holding cells, Site-54 is generally considered to be the Foundation site both best-prepared for the worst to happen, and the location at which said worst is most likely to occur.</p>

However, recent Overwatch audits suggest its expansion has surpassed its budgetary and logistical limitations, and personnel frequently cite its "labyrinthine" structure as a detriment to day-to-day operations.</p>

<p>Site-58 is the Foundation's premier site for sapient humanoid and zoological anomalies.

As a result anomalies are granted a level of freedom on site, allowed privileges within reason.</p>
<p>Site-58 is also one of the Foundation's only publicly accessible sites, having the cover story of a public therapy practice. As a result, the citizens of Nanticoke are given mild exposure to low-risk anomalies, with the Foundation believing that one day these anomalies will be permitted to live free.</p>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> Hobart, Tasmania, Australia</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> After being confiscated from a wealthy family practising demonic rituals, Site-95 was originally established as a small testing facility. After the arrival of <a href="/scp-6220">SCP-6220</a>, the site became a containment and research site for biological entities, and the Entomology, Mycology and Botany departments were formed.</p>
<p>Today, Site-95 is the headquarters of the Entomology Department as well as a major hub for the Mycology and Botany departments. Site-95 is known for being both relaxed and chaotic, and is often regarded with disdain by the wider Foundation. However, the Site is rapidly growing, and is one of the most densely populated Foundation Facilities.</p>
<p>The Site's most notable feature is the large on-site garden. Although it is commonly used to experiment with and contain anomalies, it is often used by members for relaxation purposes when not in use for research purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> West of Giza, Egypt</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Site-107, founded in early July of 2023, was established as a Foundation base in collaboration with the Arab Republic of Egypt after both entities reported a large uptick of anomalous activity within the region. The site's founding was finally approved despite several years of anomalous activity occurring within the region, with Director Heba Gomaa spearheading efforts to get a location founded on the African continent.</p>
<p>The site specializes mainly in underworld and mythological anomalies, which seem to be the most prevalent kinds of anomalies within its region. Its main purpose is to be a hub for containment and research for these anomalies. It also serves as an observation post for the Nile River, a location that has very recently become an area of high anomalous activity.</p>
<p>Currently, the site suffers from gross mismanagement, mainly stemming from a lack of funding or aid from Central Command. The effects of this mismanagement include a lack of proper cooling equipment, outdated audio/visual systems and inadequate on-site containment facilities. Site administration has often been forced into making use of hack-job solutions for resolving these issues and maintaining site operations.</p>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> Newcastle, Northern Ireland, UK</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Established in 1918, Site-400 is a large-scale containment and resource production facility, located somewhere within the forested regions of Newcastle. Disguised as a private forestry research institute, Site-400 specializes in multiple fields of anomalous science, primarily paraastronomy, metafiction, and humanoid experimentation. Ironically, a large number of personnel stationed at Site-400 exhibits anomalous properties themselves, and possess their own SCP classification.</p>
<p>While not official, it is widely accepted that Site-400 also acts as a location of expatriation, where other Foundation facilities may transport (or "deport") anomalous personnel, most frequently justified by the idea that they will "feel more comfortable with their own kind of people".</p>
