{'name': 'Level 1 - Unrestricted', 'description': 'This document is available to all Foundation employees. If someone gets a regular paycheck from The Foundation, they can see this document.'}
{'name': 'Level 2 - Restricted', 'description': 'This document is available to the majority of employees upon request. If the employee has a subordinate, then they are already granted Level 2 access. If an employee does not have any subordinates, then they must request access to the document from their supervisor.'}
{'name': 'Level 3 - Confidential', 'description': 'This document is available to the minority of employees. The primary administrative staff of a Site will have Level 3 access. If an employee has a subordinate but does not have Level 3 access, they must request access to the document from their site administrative staff. If an employee does not have a subordinate, they must request access from their supervisor who will then request access from the site administrative staff.'}
{'name': 'Level 4 - Secret', 'description': 'This document is ONLY available to site and Foundation administrative staff. Access to employees without Level 4 access will, generally, be declined and only approved for very specific purposes.'}
{'name': 'Level 5 - Top Secret', 'description': 'This document is ONLY available to the highest Foundation Administrative Staff, such as the Ethics Committee or the O5 Council. Anyone without Level 5 access will always be denied.'}
{'name': 'Level 6 - Cosmic Top Secret', 'description': 'This document is ONLY available to a member of the O5 Council. All access to this document is granted solely at the discretion of an O5 Council member.'}

{'name': 'Safe', 'description': 'Safe-class SCPs are anomalies that are easily and safely contained. This is often due to the fact that the Foundation has researched the SCP well enough that containment does not require significant resources or that the anomalies require a specific and conscious activation or trigger. Classifying an SCP as Safe, however, does not mean that handling or activating it does not pose a threat.'}
{'name': 'Euclid', 'description': "Euclid-class SCPs are anomalies that require more resources to contain completely or where containment isn't always reliable. Usually this is because the SCP is insufficiently understood or inherently unpredictable. Euclid is the Object Class with the greatest scope, and it's usually a safe bet that an SCP will be this class if it doesn't easily fall into any of the other standard Object Classes.\n\nAs a note, any SCP that's autonomous or sapient is generally classified as Euclid, due to the inherent unpredictability of an object that can act or think on its own."}
{'name': 'Keter', 'description': "Keter-class SCPs are anomalies that are exceedingly difficult to contain consistently or reliably, with containment procedures often being extensive and complex. The Foundation often can't contain these SCPs well due to not having a solid understanding of the anomaly, or lacking the technology to properly contain or counter it. A Keter SCP does not mean the SCP is dangerous, just that it is simply very difficult or costly to contain."}
{'name': 'Neutralized', 'description': 'Neutralized SCPs are former anomalies that are no longer anomalous, either through having been intentionally or accidentally destroyed or disabled.'}
{'name': 'Explained', 'description': 'Explained SCPs are commonly articles about anomalies that are completely and fully understood, to the point where their effects are now explainable by mainstream science, or phenomena that have been debunked or falsely mistaken as an anomaly.'}
{'name': 'Decommissioned', 'description': 'Decommissioned SCPs are anomalies that have been intentionally destroyed or stripped of their anomalous properties by the SCP Foundation. As the Foundation usually tries to contain rather than neutralize anomalous objects, this object class is only used when it is not possible to fully contain an anomaly, or when excessive expenditure of resources is required to keep an anomaly in containment. Decommissioning may also be performed for ethical reasons, particularly when containment necessitates extreme suffering or is unable to prevent excessive loss of life. To avoid any unnecessary losses, decommissioning anomalies requires authorization from a higher authority, such as the O5 Council, the Ethics Committee, or the Decommissioning Department.'}
{'name': 'Pending', 'description': 'SCP articles that have not yet been assigned an object class may be labelled as Pending. This is used to indicate that the Foundation does not currently have enough information to assign an object class to the anomaly. This is a deliberate decision to emphasise that research is ongoing.'}
{'name': 'Uncontained', 'description': 'SCPs that are not yet contained may be assigned an object class, often Keter, but in some articles Uncontained is used in place of an object class to emphasise that ongoing effort is required to establish or restore containment.'}

{'name': 'Level 1 - Dark', 'description': 'The known or potential disruption is so low as to not be a concern.\nThe object is essentially inert when not interacted with and may potentially only affect a single individual.\n\nThe Foundation would find it trivial to clean up after it.'}
{'name': 'Level 2 - Vlam', 'description': 'The known or potential disruption would be localized to a small handful of people.\n\nThe anomalous effects certainly do affect multiple people, but it would not extend very far.\n\nThe Foundation would find it relatively simple to neutralize its effects.'}
{'name': 'Level 3 - Keneq', 'description': 'The known or potential disruption would be extended to a number of people roughly defined as a city.\n\nThe anomalous effects could spread with fairly significant speed, fast enough as to cause concern.\n\nThe Foundation would find it moderately difficult to neutralize its effects.'}
{'name': 'Level 4 - Ekhi', 'description': 'The known disruption would extend to roughly the size of a large metropolitan area to an entire country. The potential disruption could extend to the entire known world.\n\nThe spread would be swift and difficult to manage.\n\nThe Foundation would find it quite difficult to neutralize its effects.'}
{'name': 'Level 5 - Amida', 'description': "This Disruption Class should be reserved for special circumstances when The Foundation is essentially 'declaring war' on an anomaly. When an anomaly poses such a dire threat to the status quo and The Foundation's veil that there is no other option than to use all possible options in order to Neutralize it.\n\nThe effects of an Amida anomaly would extend to the entire known world and possibly the entire universe."}

{'name': 'Level 1 - Notice', 'description': 'The anomalous effects of the object are nearly non-existent to mild.\nAn individual within close proximity of the object would not feel anything as a result of the object.\n\nIt poses no danger to any individual nearby.\n'}
{'name': 'Level 2 - Caution', 'description': 'The anomalous effects of the object are mild to moderate.\n\nAn individual within close proximity of the object may feel mild effects from the anomalous object.\n\nIt poses mild danger to any individual nearby.'}      
{'name': 'Level 3 - Warning', 'description': 'The anomalous effect of the object are moderate to significant.\n\nAn individual within close proximity of the object will feel mild effects or may feel major effects from the anomalous object.\n\nIt poses moderate danger to any individual nearby.'}
{'name': 'Level 4 - Danger', 'description': 'The anomalous effect of the object are significant to extreme.\n\nAn individual within close proximity of the object will feel major effects or may feel extreme effects from the anomalous object.\n\nIt poses significant danger to any individual nearby.'}
{'name': 'Level 5 - Critical', 'description': "This Risk Class should only be chosen when the object's effects will be near instant and/or extremely severe.\n\nIt does not, necessarily, need to cause actual death, but death is incredibly likely and expected. Any individual nearby will feel the effects near instantly and the possibility of recovery is impossible."}

{'name': 'Containment Specialist', 'description': 'Containment specialists have two main roles at Foundation facilities. Firstly, containment teams are called upon to respond to confirmed cases of anomalous activity to secure and establish initial containment over anomalous objects, entities, or phenomena and transport them to the nearest Foundation containment site.\n\nIn addition, Foundation containment engineers and technicians are called upon to devise, refine, and maintain containment units and schemes for objects, entities, and phenomena in Foundation facilities.'}
{'name': 'Researcher', 'description': "Researchers are the scientific branch of the Foundation, drawn from the ranks of the smartest and best-trained research scientists from around the world. With specialists in every field imaginable, from chemistry and botany to more esoteric or specialized fields such as theoretical physics and xenobiology, the goal of the Foundation's research projects is to gain a better understanding of unexplained anomalies and how they operate."}
{'name': 'Security Officer', 'description': "On-site security officers — often referred to simply as guards — at Foundation facilities are tasked with maintaining physical and information security for Foundation projects, operations, and personnel. Primarily drawn and recruited from military, law enforcement, and correctional facility personnel, security officers are trained in the use of all types of weapons as well as a variety of contingency plans covering both containment breach incidents as well as hostile action. These personnel are also responsible for information security, such as making sure that sensitive documents are not misplaced and that a facility's computer systems are safe from outside intrusion. They are also often the first line of defense against hostile outside forces for Foundation facilities."}
{'name': 'Tactical Response Officer', 'description': "Response teams — or tactical teams — are highly trained and heavily armed combat teams tasked with escorting containment teams when dangerous anomalous entities or hostile Groups of Interest are involved and defending Foundation facilities against hostile action. Response teams are effectively military units stationed at major Foundation facilities that are ready to deploy at a moment's notice."}
{'name': 'Field Agent', 'description': 'Field agents are the eyes and ears of the Foundation, personnel trained to look for and investigate signs of anomalous activity, often undercover with local or regional law enforcement or embedded in local services such as emergency medical services and regulatory organizations. As undercover units, field agents are typically not equipped to deal with confirmed cases of anomalous activity; once such an incident has been confirmed and isolated, field agents will typically call for assistance from the nearest field containment team with the means to safely secure and contain such anomalies.'}
{'name': 'Mobile Task Force Operative', 'description': 'Mobile Task Forces are specialist units comprised of veteran field personnel drawn from all over the Foundation. These task forces are mobilized to deal with threats of a specific nature and can include anything from field researchers specializing in a particular type of anomaly to heavily armed combat units tasked to secure certain types of hostile anomalous entity. See the Task Forces document for more detailed information.'}
{'name': 'Site Director', 'description': 'Site directors for major Foundation facilities are the highest-ranking personnel at that location and are responsible for the continued, safe operation of the site and all of its contained anomalies and projects. All major departmental directors report directly to the Site Director, who in turn reports to the O5 Council.'}
{'name': 'O5 Council Member', 'description': 'The O5 Council refers to the committee consisting of the highest-ranking directors of the Foundation. With complete access to all information regarding anomalies in containment, the O5 Council oversees all Foundation operations worldwide and directs its long-term strategic plans. Due to the sensitivity of their positions, O5 Council members must not come into direct contact with any anomalous object, entity, or phenomenon. Furthermore, the identities of all O5 Council members is classified; all council members are referred to only by their numeric designation (O5-1 through O5-13).'}
