### A simple guide to interperting foundation clearance levels from @AngryMan
* One: Anyone
* Two: Anyone who isn't literally a new hire
* Three: Anyone who has some level of control over others (managers, supervisors, team leads, etc.)
* Four: Anyone who has control of the operations of ~100 people (eg. people in site administration other than the director)
* Five: Anyone with enough control to significantly impact operations on a Foundation-scale (ethics committee, site directors, MTF commanders, etc)
* Six: Anyone who mom said is allowed to play with the big boy toys
