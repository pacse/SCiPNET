Safe SCPs are anomalies that are easily and safely contained. 
This is often due to the fact that the SCP has been researched well enough that containment does not require significant resources or that the anomalies require a specific and conscious activation or trigger. 
Classifying an SCP as Safe, however, does not mean that handling or activating it does not pose a threat.
