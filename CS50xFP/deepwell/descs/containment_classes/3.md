Keter SCPs are anomalies that are exceedingly difficult to contain consistently or reliably, with containment procedures often being extensive and complex. 
The Foundation often can't contain these SCPs well due to not having a solid understanding of the anomaly, or lacking the technology to properly contain or counter it.
A Keter designation does not mean the SCP is dangerous, just that it is simply very difficult or costly to contain.
