> **Dr. Itkin:** SCP-049, we are conducting this interview to close out our investigation of your actions taken on April 16th that resulted in the death of a staff member. Do you have any comments to make?
>
> **SCP-049:** Only that I look forward to the day when you will allow me to resume my work! I have spent the last few weeks compiling my notes and constructing a new theory for how the Pestilence was able to infect someone in such an insidious manner that I nearly couldn't detect it.
>
> **Dr. Itkin:** Have you experienced any remorse for your actions? For the death of Dr. Hamm?
>
> **SCP-049:** (*Waves his hand*) Ah, yes. Well, the death of a colleague is always regrettable, but in the face of the Pestilence we must be *swift*, doctor, and act without hesitation.
>
> **Dr. Itkin:** Dr. Sherman noted in his report that you seemed to be mournful during your initial interview.
>
> **SCP-049:** Mourn- (*Pauses*) Perhaps. I had not thought that� It is lamentable that a fellow doctor became infected, but the work continues. Regrettable as� as it was, Dr. Hamm's death provided important insight. Living human subjects are the only way to proceed forward, I am decided. My cure is of little use on dead flesh, and I have gleaned all I can from your generous supply of corpses. My desires turn towards tending to those still living who suffer from the disease.
>
> **Dr. Itkin:** I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed.
>
> **SCP-049:** (*Laughs*)
Oh doctor, I wouldn't be so sure.
